# Functional Programming

Frontend-data final application.

I've chosen to continue with my work from [functional-programming]("github.com/rbntimes/functional-programming") and to further explore what i can do with the database of the "Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen".
De App is live over [here]("rbntimes.github.io/frontend-data").

## How do I get it to work

Simple:

```js
> git clone
> yarn
> yarn dev
```

## How does it work

You can read all about the idea, the database and the techniques i've used over at my [wiki](https://github.com/rbntimes/frontend-data/wiki)
